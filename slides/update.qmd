## Motivation
### Increasing availability of firm production networks data! 

![Countries with firm production networks data](images/map_data_availability.png){#fig-map_data_availability}

## Motivation
### Exciting research agendas

- [**Tax compliance:**]{.alert} @almuniaStrategicConfusedFirmsforthcoming and @carrilloGhostingTaxAuthority2022. 
- [**Transmission of micro and macroeconomic shocks through production networks:**]{.alert} @Acemoglu2012TheFluctuations, @Huneeus2020ProductionShocks, @Dhyne2022ForeignImpacts, @CevallosFujiy2022ProductionSubstitution, @Dhyne2021TradeNetworks, and @Demir2022FinancialNetworks. 
- [**Earnings inequality:**]{.alert} @adaoImportsExportsEarnings2022 and@Huneeus2022EarningsNetworks. 
- [**Endogenous network formation:**]{.alert} @Panagrahi2022EndogenousProductivity, @Arkolakis2021SpatialNetworks, @Bernard2022TheApproach, @Bernard2019ProductionPerformance
- [**Supply chain disruptions:**]{.alert} @Carvalho2021SupplyEarthquake and @CevallosFujiy2022ProductionSubstitution. 

## Motivation
### Are the results obtained in one country applicable to all of them?
#### Threats to our study. 

- [Data collection.]{.bg} 
- [Informality. ]{.bg} 
- [Auditing:]{.bg}  @almuniaStrategicConfusedFirmsforthcoming and @pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015. 
- [Institutions. ]{.bg} 

## Motivation
### Are the results obtained in one country applicable to all of them?
#### Different topographies and geographies

## Motivation
### Are the results obtained in one country applicable to all of them?
#### Other very important considerations

- Data collection. 
- Informality. 
- Auditing: @almuniaStrategicConfusedFirmsforthcoming and @pomeranzNoTaxationInformation2015. 
- Institutions. 

## This paper
1. Describe the coverage and cleaning of the data. 
2. Describe the firms and their relationships in formal sector of Costa Rica. 
  - Number of workers
  - Total sales. 
  - Firm-to-firm transactions: sales and purchases. 
  - Number of customers and suppliers. 

## This paper
3. Replicate and provide 15 (new) stylised facts found in developed countries' production networks. 
  - Firm-to-firm relationships. 
  - The role of geography in these relationships. 
  - Exposure to international trade. 
4. Compare these stylised facts to those reported in other countries. 
5. Provide replication package to other researchers.

## Crash course on production networks
### Weighted directed network/graph.

## Data
### Available in Costa Rica
![Agents](images/fig_production_network_agents.png)

## Data
### Sources
- [Employer-Employee Administrative Data (2006-2019):]{.fg} wage, firm industry,  plant location. 
- [VAT Administrative data (2008-2019):]{.fg} annual firm-to-firm transactions, customers, suppliers, firm industry, administrative location. At least 2.5 million Costa Rican colones. (~$4,200)
- [Corporate Tax Administrative data (2008-2019):]{.fg} Balances sheets with revenue, profits, costs, fixed assets, others. 
- [Customs data (2008-2019):]{.fg} yearly firm-level imports and exports. 

## Data
### Sample selection
- Firms with one permanent worker anually. 
- Exclude the Diplomatics Activities sector. 

**After cleaning procedure we capture in a given year between**

- 94.5 and 97.4% of total sales. 
- 81.5 and 87.9% of network sales across firms. 
- 78.5 and 84.8% of transactions across firms. 

**Agents in the economy**

- 96,177 businesses and 3,839,030 connections between buyers and suppliers. 
- About 38 thousand businesses and 300 thousand transactions in a given year. 


## Data
### Sectoral composition is persistent in time

![Total sales](images/figure_A4.png){width=5in}

## Data
### Share of buyers and/or sellers is also persistent in time

![Total sales](images/figure_A2.png){width=5in}

## Data
### Upstream (downstream) sectors are more likely to be only sell (buy) from other firms

## Stylised facts

::: {.callout-note title="Main message"}
The number of customers/suppliers is the key driver of a firm-to-firm sales. 
:::

### Domestic firm-to-firm trade
1. Domestic production networks are sparse. 
2. The distributions of firm sales, network sales and purchases, and buyer-supplier connections show substantial dispersion. 
3. Firm size is positively correlated to the number of connections to other firms. 
4. Firm size is positively correlated to the number of municipalities and number of industries with which a firm trades. 
5. The number of links accounts for more than half of the variation in the total value of firm-to-firm sales and purchases. As we aggregate sales and purchases from the firm-level to the industry-level, the value of the average transaction with buyers or suppliers becomes more important.

:::

### Domestic firm-to-firm trade

6. The distribution of sales (purchases) among customers (suppliers) does not vary substantially with the number of customers (suppliers). 
7. The production network displays negative degree assortativity between sellers and buyers. 
8. Top customers (suppliers) account for a high percentage of a firm’s sales (purchases). 
9. The persistence of firm-to-firm linkages increases with firm size.

:::

### The geography of domestic firm-to-firm trade

10. Most firm-to-firm linkages are formed between nearby firms. 
11. Trade flows between municipalities increase in the geographical proximity between the municipalities. 
12. The number of connections decays with distance and travel time faster than the average transaction. 

### Firm-to-firm trade within and across borders
13. Importer (exporter) firms are larger than non-importer (non-exporter) firms. 
14. Most firms do not import or export directly, but most do so indirectly. 
15. Direct and total export and import shares increase with firm size.

## Stylised facts
### Firms within a sector are heterogenous
